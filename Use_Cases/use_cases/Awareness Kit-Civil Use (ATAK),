=== Choose Awareness Kit-Civil Use (ATAK) and Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)

*Contributed By:* Ryan Fleming

*Motivation:* 
Military, government employees and contractors will want to find routes between 2 points of interest.  The user will want to plot points on a map to make notes along routes and on the map.

*Summary*
The points within ATAK and OSRM will help users to identify points along the map and help other users. 
In order to choose a restaurant to eat in or get delivery from, users need to find restaurants near them
and information about those restaurants to help decide which, if any, they want to use.

*Related Use Cases*

*Roles:*
•	Military routing and intelligence analysis
•	Government support to military or other partners
•	Contractors  support to government, military or partners
*Devices:*
Users can use a computer, mobile device or tablet. 
Users may want to choose a restaurant using a computer, a mobile phone, or an in-auto navigation system.

*Data:*
The data will have attributes for each point of interest such location, name, type of point of interest, hours.  If the point is a coordinate, the user can choose a point from points list. 
The data will be attributes of restaurants such as: location, name, type of cuisine, business hours, price level, etc.

*Dependencies:*
Ability to install Vehicle Navigation System (VNS), compatible with ATAK onto a mobile phone or tablet.  The other dependency is the ability for the offline routing server to function properly with the graphopper file. 
*Requirements:*
System requirements as well as branch or user needs requirements. 

*Variants:*
•	Choose point of interest icon such as lodging, restaurant, supermarket, etc.
•	Chose generic icon that isn’t in database or is a coordinate along with color and shape.

*Security Considerations: *
User should have secure session that is privates but should have the ability to share with other users if needed.
